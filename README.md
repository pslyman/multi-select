# MultiSelect

This was part of a small hackathon. Mostly functional multi-select modal. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## About

This is a proof of concept for Angular Mutli-Select dropdowns. Search does not work, nor does de-select-all. In the future I may remedy that. Multi-Select is entirely functional and mobile friendly.
